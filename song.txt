Things we lost to the flames
Things we'll never see again
All that we've amassed
Sits before us, shattered into ash
… These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
… We sat and made a list
Of all the things that we have
Down the backs of table tops
Ticket stubs and your diaries, I read them all one day
